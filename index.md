_Welcome_ to the public page for the course on Security and Privacy in Machine Learning (SPML). The main objectives of the course are to introduce students to the principles of security and privacy in machine learning. The students become familiar with the vulnerabilities of machine learning in the training and inference phases and the methods to improve the robustness and privacy of machine learning models.

**Course Policy**

-   This course considers topics involving personal and public privacy
    and security. As part of this investigation we will cover
    technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an
    instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies.
    Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or
    privacy measurements for any purpose, or the dissemination,
    promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services.
    Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting
    vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any
    activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be
    reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from
    the class. When in doubt, please contact the instructor for advice. **Do not**
    undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse
    anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received
    explicit permission from Dr. Sadeghzadeh.



**Academic Honesty**

**Homework Submission**

Submit your answers in .pdf or .zip file in course page on Quera website, with the following format:
HW[HW#]-[FamilyName]-[std#] (For example HW3-Hoseini-401234567)



**Late Policy**

* All students have 21 free late days for the assignments.
* You may use up to 7 late days per assignment with no penalty.
* Once you have exhausted your free late days, we will deduct a late penalty of 20% per additional late day.
